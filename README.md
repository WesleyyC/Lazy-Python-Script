Some python scripts I wrote when I feel lazy... In the end of the day, Computer Scienctist don't do things themselves.

**- getFileWeb.py:** Use wget download all the file, with a specific type, from the base url that is given.

**- Jo's Flash Drive/ labelJPG.py:** Label all the pictures (jpg) in the folder with number starting from 0.

**- Jo's Flash Drive/ updateREADME.py:** A script that change the content in a secret file for Jo. It will automatically update the date, locations, numbers given the status of the folder.
